# Intro
Hey! This is an Aim Trainer I made for one my CS classes based in Java. The game itself is pretty self-explanatory; the hardest part is just learning what
each of the different targets do (the right side explains it depending on difficulty). Changing the difficulty will add/take away some of the 
types of targets you'll see, so keep that in mind!
